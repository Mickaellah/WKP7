# WKP7 - Library

## Code structure.

I created some objects that I am going to generate into HTML. I grabbed all the elements that I might need during the time that I am coding. Then, I generated the objects into HTML by looping through them using map() method and created an HTML string and also used ${} to access the information from the objects and add it into DOM. Use a few functions to the code and few event listeners to listen to the appropriate clicks.

## About improvement.

If I had more time I would try to work with the delete button and the local storage as well. Improve the stucture of my code (Javascript and css).

## Something that I learned.

I learnt that we should always call the function after it is declared when we generate objects into HTML. There weren't really new things in this project, all the technics that we should use in this project are technics that we have seen like event delegation, generate object into HTML, use of map().

## Challenge.

For me, the most challenging part was trying to make figure out what is wrong with the local storage and to get the delete buttons work which I didn't get yet.

## More explanation.

I woul like more explanation about the checkboxes and the delete button.

## Comments.

I couldn't deal with lots of things this time, I focused with one thing at a time and I spent most of my time to figure out my problem with the checkboxes.
